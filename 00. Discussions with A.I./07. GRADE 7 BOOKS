Got it! You want a Grade 7 reading list â€” excluding African books and To Kill a Mockingbird-style classics â€” so something fresh but still rich in moral insight, critical thinking, character growth, and cultural perspective.

Hereâ€™s a curated list of books for Grade 7 (ages 12â€“13) that focus on life lessons, empathy, social issues, and intellectual depth, without being the usual classics:
