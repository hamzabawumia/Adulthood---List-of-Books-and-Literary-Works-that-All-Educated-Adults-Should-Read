FROM GRADE 6 ONWARDS I WANT MY CHILD TO LEARN ALSO ABOUT OTHER CULTURE'S HISTORIES, like chinese history or russian history with a focus on character building, critical thinking, moral maturity, the good and bad sides of humans, etc rather than just learning dates of events. 
ChatGPT said:

That's a powerful and thoughtful approach to educating your child — using literature and history from multiple cultures to nurture:

✅ Moral maturity

✅ Character development

✅ Critical thinking about good and evil

✅ Empathy across cultures

✅ Real understanding of world history — not just memorizing dates

From Grade 6 onwards, children can start exploring deeper ideas like injustice, sacrifice, courage, greed, power, and redemption — through real and fictional stories from other civilizations.
